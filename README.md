Welcome! In this workshop, we'll present to you how to train YOLOv7 to detect a new object.  
  
To complete this workshop, follow the steps:  
1) Clone this repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/ricardosanunes/sinfo.git`
2) Perform the steps in the notebook:  
   `presentation.ipynb`  
---
The implementation will have two datasets with photos of the new object:
- Good dataset: plenty images from different angles and backgrounds
- Bad dataset: fewer images, only from a few angles and mostly with the same background  
<br>
To train the model with your own images, you must label them. For that, we recommend using [label-studio](https://labelstud.io/).
